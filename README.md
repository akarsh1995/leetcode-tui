# Leetcode TUI

# Use Leetcode in your terminal.

![Demo](https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-44GmR9FJgOHtWRU0UPVJam.gif)

### Why this TUI:

My motivation for creating leetcode-tui stemmed from my preference for tools that are lightweight and consume fewer system resources. When I explored existing leetcode CLI tools on GitHub, I came across a few raw command-line interfaces, but they lacked the interactivity I desired.
To address this, I decided to develop leetcode-tui, a Text-based User Interface, that provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for solving LeetCode problems.
